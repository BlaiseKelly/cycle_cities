# Cycling Cities


Using the [osmactive package](https://github.com/nptscot/osmactive), the
cycle routes for a number of cities, picked for personal interest and
knowledge of which ones might have good infrastructure, were imported,
plotted and some stats calculated (table below).


    Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':

        filter, lag

    The following objects are masked from 'package:base':

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

On average the Dutch cities have over 1metre of segregated cycle
infrastructure per person in each city. In the UK it is around half of
this.

A plot of some of the cities is shown below. An interactive plot is
shown in the tab [City Cycle
Paths](%22https://blaisekelly.github.io/cycle_cities/all_cities.html%22)
