# Cycling Cities


Using the [osmactive package](https://github.com/nptscot/osmactive), the
cycle routes for a number of cities, picked for personal interest and
knowledge of which ones might have good infrastructure, were imported,
plotted and some stats calculated (table below).

On average the Dutch cities have over 1metre of segregated cycle
infrastructure per person in each city. In the UK it is around half of
this.

A plot of some of the cities is shown below. An interactive plot is
shown in the tab [City Cycle
Paths](%22https://blaisekelly.github.io/cycle_cities/all_cities.html%22)
